https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implement-runnable-vs-extend-thread-in-java/

When we extend Thread class, we canâ€™t extend any other class even we require and When we implement 
Runnable, we can save a space for our class to extend any other class in future or now.

When we extend Thread class, each of our thread creates unique object and associate with it. 
When we implements Runnable, it shares the same object to multiple threads.

NOTE : In the case of multithreading we cant predict the exact order of output because it will vary 
from system to system or JVM to JVM.
