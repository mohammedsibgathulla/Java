HashMap is a part of Java’s collection since Java 1.2. It provides the basic implementation of the Map interface of Java. It stores the data in (Key, Value) pairs. To access a value one must know its key. HashMap is known as HashMap because it uses a technique called Hashing. Hashing is a technique of converting a large String to small String that represents the same String. A shorter value helps in indexing and faster searches. HashSet also uses HashMap internally. It internally uses a link list to store key-value pairs already explained in HashSet in detail and further articles.
Few important features of HashMap are:

    HashMap is a part of java.util package.
    HashMap extends an abstract class AbstractMap which also provides an incomplete implementation of Map interface.
    It also implements Cloneable and Serializable interface. K and V in the above definition represent Key and Value respectively.
    HashMap doesn’t allow duplicate keys but allows duplicate values. That means A single key can’t contain more than 1 value but more than 1 key can contain a single value.
    HashMap allows null key also but only once and multiple null values.
    This class makes no guarantees as to the order of the map; in particular, it does not guarantee that the order will remain constant over time. It is roughly similar to HashTable but is unsynchronized.
    
Internally HashMap contains an array of Node and a node is represented as a class which contains 4 fields:    
1. int hash
2. K key
3. V value
4. Node next

Performance of HashMap depends on 2 parameters:
1. Initial Capacity
2. Load Factor

As already said, Capacity is simply the number of buckets whereas the Initial Capacity is the capacity of HashMap instance when it is created. The Load Factor is a measure that when rehashing should be done. Rehashing is a process of increasing the capacity. In HashMap capacity is multiplied by 2. Load Factor is also a measure that what fraction of the HashMap is allowed to fill before rehashing. When the number of entries in HashMap increases the product of current capacity and load factor the capacity is increased that is rehashing is done. 
If the initial capacity is kept higher then rehashing will never be done. But by keeping it higher it increases the time complexity of iteration. So it should be chosen very cleverly to increase performance. The expected number of values should be taken into account to set initial capacity. Most generally preferred load factor value is 0.75 which provides a good deal between time and space costs. Load factor’s value varies between 0 and 1.

As it is told that HashMap is unsynchronized i.e. multiple threads can access it simultaneously. If multiple threads access this class simultaneously and at least one thread manipulates it structurally then it is necessary to make it synchronized externally. It is done by synchronizing some object which encapsulates the map. 
If No such object exists then it can be wrapped around Collections.synchronizedMap() to make HashMap synchronized and avoid accidental unsynchronized access. As in the following example:
Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap(...))
Now the Map m is synchronized.
Iterators of this class are fail-fast if any structure modification is done after the creation of iterator, in any way except through the iterator’s remove method. In a failure of iterator, it will throw ConcurrentModificationException.
